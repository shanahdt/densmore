Look again at choctaw40.  It is in two parts.
See Densmore's note page 157.

choct46.krn - notated as alternating 2/4 --> 3/4,
but really in 5/4 meter

Many Choctaw works seem to end with stereotypic
"cadences."  The final tone is often repeated,
with a rhythm such as:
32r, 32A = 4A 8A 8r ==
That is, there is a trochee ending preceded by
a very short pickup (often the shortest note in the
song), which itself is preceded by a rest.
This pattern is evident in
Nos. 31, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50,
And less evident in Nos. 1, 13, 41, 49, 51a, 51b, 53

choct52.krn and choct53.krn encode different
renditions of the same song by the same singer.
This provides an interesting contrast, and useful
reminder of the flexibility of individual songs.

choct54.krn and choct55.krn also encode different
renditions of the same song by the same singer.
Notice in both pairs of renditions that the
singer maintained the same "key".
In choct52.krn anc choct53.krn the tempos are
strikingly different, and since the second rendition
has 5 lines to the first's 7 lines, the faster
tempo means that the second rendition is of much
shorter overall duration.

I'll bet that the average pitch height for the first
note in each measure is higher than the average pitch
height for the last note in each measure.
