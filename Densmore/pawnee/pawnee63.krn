!!!HAO:    The song next following was used as an old war dance.
!!!HAO: It was the custom of the young men, in former times, to make
!!!HAO: known that they had arrived at an age of realization and had "put
!!!HAO: their trust in the heavens."  James R. Murie said that he, as a
!!!HAO: young man, went around the village singing this song with other
!!!HAO: young men, so that all the people might hear and know they had
!!!HAO: assumed the attitude of men toward life.  It is an Iruska but not
!!!HAO: a dancing song and belonged to Man Chief.
!!!HTX: My spirit rests in the belief that power is in the heavens.
