!!!HAO:    The singer said that when he was a young man living in
!!!HAO: Nebraska he saw a very old man who used a cane.  Even
!!!HAO: with this aid he could scarcely walk.  This old man had
!!!HAO: a dream in which he ascended a high hill and sat down.
!!!HAO: The clouds were below him and he saw rain falling from
!!!HAO: the clouds; he also saw about 40 white horses and
!!!HAO: drove them; the white horses were probably the shapes
!!!HAO: assumed by the clouds in his dream.  The following song
!!!HAO: belonged to this old man but was not related to the
!!!HAO: foregoing dream.  It was sung in the Bear dance.
!!!HTX: Listen, he said, I come,
!!!HTX: He told this to me,
!!!HTX: I came to a place where I was lost in the timbre,
!!!HTX: I came to the place,
!!!HTX: Now I come.
