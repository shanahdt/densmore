!!!HAO: [story continued from previous song]
!!!HAO:    The strange boy (who was his brother) said, "Nuri, you are having a
!!!HAO: good time with your father but I am here with my grandmothers, the wood
!!!HAO: rates.  Your father is my father too.  I have plenty of wild grapes and
!!!HAO: cherries but I do not have any meat to eat."  Nuri said, "Come into the
!!!HAO: lodge and I will give you some."  The strange boy sniffed the air and
!!!HAO: asked, "Is your father here?"  "No," said Nuri.  The strange boy went into
!!!HAO: the lodge and played until it was time for their father to return.  Then
!!!HAO: he ran away, saying, "Forget, forget," so that Nuri would not tell their
!!!HAO: father.  This child was a "wonder boy" and he came every day until both
!!!HAO: boys were quite grown.  One day he failed to say "Forget" when he went
!!!HAO: away.  As the boy and his father were eating their supper Nuri said,
!!!HAO: "Father, I want to tell you something.  There is a little boy who comes
!!!HAO: every day to play with me while you are away."  The man said to himself,
!!!HAO: "I will try to catch the boy."  So one morning he hid instead of going
!!!HAO: away.  The wonder boy came as usual, singing the same little song.  He
!!!HAO: stopped and sniffed the air, saying to Nuri, "Your father is here."  "No,"
!!!HAO: said Nuri, "Perhaps you smell his blanket."  "It is certainly he," said the
!!!HAO: boy, and ran away.  The father determined to catch the boy by a trick and
!!!HAO: told Nuri how to tie a thong around his brother's scalplock.  In the
!!!HAO: struggle that ensued the wonder-boy's scalplock was torn from his head
!!!HAO: and held by the thong.  The father kept the scalplock gave the boys a good
!!!HAO: supper, and told them to stay in the lodge.
!!!HAO:    Nuri obeyed his father, but as time passed, his brother continually
!!!HAO: tried to lead him into danger.  When Nuri objected his brother would say,
!!!HAO: "Give me my hair and I will go back to my grandmothers."  Then Nuri would
!!!HAO: yield, but the boys always returned in safety.  One day they brought
!!!HAO: snake rattles and hung them on the door of the lodge.  Another day they
!!!HAO: went to a place where a boat was moored.  If anyone went in his boat it
!!!HAO: upset, threw the people into the water, and then returned to its place by
!!!HAO: the shore.  The wonder boy wanted to go in the boat but Nuri objected.
!!!HAO: The boy said as before, "Then you must give me my hair and I will go back
!!!HAO: to my grandmothers."  Nuri yielded and they went in the boat, which soon
!!!HAO: began tipping endwise and sidewise.  "Do as I do," cried the wonder-boy,
!!!HAO: moving his arms and making a noise like a wild goose.  Nuri imitated him
!!!HAO: and the boys flew away.  Before leaving the boat they sand the following
!!!HAO: song.
!!!HAO:    After they flew away the boat returned to the landing.
!!!HAO:    Then the wonder boy wanted to go where the people lived who killed his
!!!HAO: mother.  These people lived in straw huts and when they saw the boys they
!!!HAO: said, "These boys are fat; we will have a good feast."  The wonder boy
!!!HAO: heard them talking.  They called to the boys and said, "Come in soon, we
!!!HAO: will have the feast ready," and aside they said, "The boys have no sense."
!!!HAO: Nuri was afraid but his brother said, "Do not cry.  We will destroy them.
!!!HAO: If we do not they will kill us."  The boys went into the lodge and saw a
!!!HAO: kettle full of boiling water.  The wonder boy said, "Do as I do."  Then
!!!HAO: both boys jumped on the edge of the kettle and upset it.  The boiling
!!!HAO: water fell on the people but the boys flew out of the lodge like burned
!!!HAO: leaves.  The people fought and killed one another, thinking they were
!!!HAO: killing the boys, and the lodge burned up.  These people had long sharp
!!!HAO: bones at the points of their elbows and heels and on the back of their
!!!HAO: heads.  When they were dead the boys took off three or four of these
!!!HAO: points.  The wonder boy said, "Let us take these home for farther to use
!!!HAO: in sewing moccasins."
!!!HAO:    This frightened the father and that night he made up his mind to run
!!!HAO: away and leave the boys.  The wonder boy knew that his father would do
!!!HAO: this but Nuri cried the next morning, when his father had gone.  The
!!!HAO: brother said, "Father has left us but we will search until we find him."
!!!HAO: So the boys started to find their father.  At first they saw no trace,
!!!HAO: and whenever they met a snake, a bear, or even a little but the wonder
!!!HAO: boy would ask, "Have you seen my father?"  They replied "No."  After the
!!!HAO: boys had traveled a long time the brother said to Nuri, "Are you tired?"
!!!HAO: Nuri said that he was tired, and his brother summoned a tiger (mountain
!!!HAO: lion?) and both boys rode on his back.  When they had traveled a long way
!!!HAO: farther they came to a village and asked, "Have you seen our father?"  The
!!!HAO: people replied, "Yes, we saw him going north."  The boys traveled all
!!!HAO: that night but could not find him.  The brother said, "Let us kill all the
!!!HAO: people in every village."  Nuri cried, but yielded.  The wonder boy said,
!!!HAO: "Nur, do this."  The boys turned their heads from side to side and they
!!!HAO: rattled.  They said to the people, "If you see us you will die, and if
!!!HAO: you do not see us you will die."  The people fell over and died, one after
!!!HAO: another.  Then the boys looked all through the village but could not find
!!!HAO: their father.  At the third village they found that their father had been
!!!HAO: killed by the people.  Huri cried but his brother said, "I would not cry.
!!!HAO: He left us to starve."  They found their father's body and took it away
!!!HAO: to a high hill.  They cut two willow poles, two cottonwood, two elm, and
!!!HAO: two walnut poles, and four cedar posts about as long as the height of a
!!!HAO: man.  They worked all day doing this, and took them on the hill.  Then
!!!HAO: they laid them crosswise in a pile with sweet grass underneath and put
!!!HAO: their father's body on top of the pile.  The wonder boy said, "Father,
!!!HAO: we used to love you but now we are going to burn you up and the smoke
!!!HAO: will ascend to Tirawa; but, father, you are not dead forever, and some
!!!HAO: day we will see you again."
!!!HTX: Nuri, do this and we will turn into geese.
!!!HTX: We will not drown.
