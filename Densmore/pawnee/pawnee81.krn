!!!HAO:    In explanation of the following song the singer said, "What I am going to
!!!HAO: tell you is not a dream, for I saw it in broad daylight.  A star spoke to
!!!HAO: me and said, "Look at me; I am the one who takes pity on you and gives you
!!!HAO: good health.  Tonight, when you go home, look toward the west.  You will
!!!HAO: see two bright stars.  I am the one to the north.  I am the one who helps
!!!HAO: you.  When you sing this song you must think of me."  Then the star said,
!!!HAO: "You are not praying enough but I am helping you.  I gave you everything
!!!HAO: you needed, why do you neglect your prayers?"  The singer said that ever
!!!HAO: since that time he had prayed morning and night.
