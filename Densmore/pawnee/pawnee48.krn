!!!HAO:    Long ago, when the Pawnee "used to go traveling," they stopped
!!!HAO: at night to rest and frequently played the hand game.  Among them
!!!HAO: was a little boy, too young to play, who loved to watch the game.
!!!HAO: He was so little that he wore no clothing.  As soon as night came
!!!HAO: this little boy ran to get wood and made a big fire so that everyone
!!!HAO: would come and play the hand game.  He did not even want to eat
!!!HAO: was so anxious for them to play.  The men made this song about the
!!!HAO: little body and sang it as they played the game.
!!!HTX: They (the men) are coming,
!!!HTX: One boy is running.
