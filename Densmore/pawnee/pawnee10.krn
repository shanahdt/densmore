!!!HAO:    The next song was sung when all the participants
!!!HAO: in the Bear dance were seated.  "Mother" was said
!!!HAO: to refer to the moon, and there was said to be a
!!!HAO: similar song containing the word "Father."  A young
!!!HAO: man received this song in a dream, while mourning
!!!HAO: for his parents who had died.  He saw a woman coming
!!!HAO: toward him, and said, "Mother is coming."  The woman
!!!HAO: said, "You have seen me, now you must learn this song."
!!!HAO: The young man learned the song, lived a long time
!!!HAO: afterwards, and took part in the Bear dance.  When
!!!HAO: the song is used ceremonially there are six "stops"
!!!HAO: or verses, the general meaning of which is as follows:
!!!HAO: 1. "Mother is coming."
!!!HAO: 2. The young man, devotional by nature, imagines that he
!!!HAO:    is still mourning for his parents.
!!!HAO: 3. "Mother stands yonder."
!!!HAO: 4. The young man says, "Mother, standing in the sky, I
!!!HAO:    want you to take pitch on me."
!!!HAO: 5. "Mother now ends" (stands still).
!!!HAO: 6. "I will now say, I mean the mother who alone stands
!!!HAO:    forever in the sky" (the moon).
