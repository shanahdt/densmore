!!!HAO:    The ceremony of Painting the Buffalo Skull is held every spring by the
!!!HAO: Chaui Band of Pawnee and is in charge of Mr. Stacy Matlock, a prominent
!!!HAO: member of that band.  The closing events of the ceremony are the Buffalo
!!!HAO: and Lance dances, which were witnessed by the writer through the courtesy
!!!HAO: of Mr. Matlock, no other white person being present.  The ceremony and
!!!HAO: dances were held in a large earth lodge, several miles south of the town
!!!HAO: of Pawnee.  The opening of the lodge was toward the east.  At some
!!!HAO: distance was a framework, probably that of a sweat lodge.  Only members
!!!HAO: of the Buffalo Society were admitted to the painting of the skull, but
!!!HAO: during the Buffalo dance the skull painted a few days previously, lay on
!!!HAO: a folded blanket in front of the "altar" which was opposite the entrance.
!!!HAO: This occasion and the Lance dance held a few days later afforded exceptional
!!!HAO: opportunities to listen to Pawnee songs, but the semidarkness of the lodge
!!!HAO: and the solemnity of the occasion precluded the taking of notes upon either
!!!HAO: the music or the details of the ceremonial dances.
!!!HAO:    The chief singer at both of these dances was Wicita Blain, a blind man
!!!HAO: who received the songs by inheritance.  He led the songs which were sung
!!!HAO: at a certain position back of the altar.  At a later time he recorded the
!!!HAO: ceremonial songs here presented, also certain songs of the Bear dance,
!!!HAO: which is held in equally high esteem by the Pawnee.  John Luwak, chief of
!!!HAO: the Chaui Band, was prominent at the Lance dance and later recorded 
!!!HAO: numerous songs, including those of the Crow Lance Society.
!!!HAO:    The following song was led by Mr. Blain at the Buffalo dance attended
!!!HAO: by the writer and is a very old song concerning Mrs. Blain's uncle, whose
!!!HAO: name was Naru'dapadi.  A great herd of buffalo came to the place where
!!!HAO: the Indians were encamped and threatened the destruction of the village.
!!!HAO: Her uncle rode toward them, shouting and firing his gun in an attempt to
!!!HAO: divert them from their course, but he was caught in the herd.  There were
!!!HAO: buffalo on all sides of him as the herd swept through the camp and across
!!!HAO: a stream, carrying him with them.
!!!HTX: Listen, he said,
!!!HTX: Now it (the man) sits among them (the buffalo),
!!!HTX: These are his sayings,
!!!HTX: Now it sits among them as they come,
!!!HTX: Now they have passed through the village,
!!!HTX: Now they have crossed the stream,
!!!HTX: It flies above them here and there, shouting and calling.
