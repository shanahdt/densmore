!!!HAO:    The man to whom the next song belonged was Running Scout, a man who
!!!HAO: was very religious and remained in a Ghost dance trance for several
!!!HAO: days.  His friends thought him unbalanced but when he awoke he told
!!!HAO: them that he had been to the Messiah who told him to "go to the
!!!HAO: village."  Following this instruction, he saw many men dancing.  Some
!!!HAO: had fox skins around their heads while others used fox skins in
!!!HAO: hypnotizing their fellow dancers.  For this reason Running Scout always
!!!HAO: wore a fox skin in the Ghost dance.  The skin was not made into a cap
!!!HAO: but the head and tail were fastened together and hung at the back of
!!!HAO: his neck in such a manner that the tail rested on his shoulder.
!!!HAO: He also gave the call of the fox while he was dancing.
