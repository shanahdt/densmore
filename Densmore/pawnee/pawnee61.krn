!!!HAO:    Man Chief received numerous songs in dreams.  The first song is
!!!HAO: a war dance of the Iruska, it being said that the "spirits told
!!!HAO: him about this dance, which is different from an ordinary war dance."
!!!HAO: This society corresponds to the Hethushka of the Omaha, a society
!!!HAO: of distinguished warriors.  Before recording this song Luwak recorded
!!!HAO: the following sentences: "The song which I am about to sing belonged
!!!HAO: to Man Chief.  When he became a chief he used to go out into the
!!!HAO: storm and stand first in one place and then in another.  He heard
!!!HAO: Tirawa speak through the clouds.  He knew the heavens were the
!!!HAO: ruling power and prayed for his people."  While speaking, he beat
!!!HAO: the drum in the same tempo as in the song which followed.
!!!HTX: I stood here, I stood there,
!!!HTX: The clouds are speaking,
!!!HTX: I say, "You are the ruling power,
!!!HTX: I do not understand, I only know what I am told,
!!!HTX: You are the ruling power, you are now speaking,
!!!HTX: This power is yours, O heavens."
