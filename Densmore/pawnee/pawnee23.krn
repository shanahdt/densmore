!!!HAO:    The general idea of the next song is that it is better
!!!HAO: to die bravely when young that to live to an enfeebled
!!!HAO: old age.  In this, as in other Pawnee war songs, we see
!!!HAO: a light estimate upon the value of life as compared to
!!!HAO: success in war.  The song belonged originally to a
!!!HAO: brave man who lived to an advanced age.  When this
!!!HAO: was sung in a dance he rose and told the young men
!!!HAO: that it was a painful thing to live to be so old.
!!!HAO: The song was also sung by men in a battle, this being
!!!HAO: the last song they sang "when they were all tired out
!!!HAO: and so nearly beaten that even their hair was disheveled."
!!!HAO: It was further stated that "sometimes when men were
!!!HAO: having this dance an enemy attacked the village.
!!!HAO: This was the song they sang as they drove the enemy away."
!!!HAO: The song was also used in the scalp dances that followed
!!!HAO: the return of a successful war party.
!!!HTX: He comes.
!!!HTX: It hurts to use a cane.
!!!HTX: It becomes painful to pick it up.
