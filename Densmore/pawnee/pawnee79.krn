!!!HAO:    A man once volunteered to follow a war party and had gone only about
!!!HAO: halfway to the place of fighting when he met the warriors returning.
!!!HAO: He was one of the poorest men in all the four bands of the Pawnee.
!!!HAO: Passing through a deserted camp of his people he saw, by the circles
!!!HAO: of buffalo skulls, that offerings had been made to Tirawa.  He
!!!HAO: therefore prayed that Tirawa would help him get a horse so that he
!!!HAO: could kill some buffalo.  His prayer was answered and he became a very
!!!HAO: rich man.  This is the song in which he offered his prayer.
