!!!HAO:    The hypnotic phase which the hand game has in common with the
!!!HAO: Ghost dance is indicated in the following song which was sung at
!!!HAO: the Ghost dance and also at the hand game.  In old times the game
!!!HAO: and its accompanying dances were held on the prairie instead of
!!!HAO: inside a lodge.  A portion of the people were called "crows," and
!!!HAO: the woman who recorded this song said that she "belonged on the
!!!HAO: crow side of the circle."  At intervals these people gave the caw
!!!HAO: of the crow and imitated that bird in their dancing.  (This was
!!!HAO: done in the dance connected with the hand game attended by the
!!!HAO: writer.)  It is said that under the hypnotic influence of the
!!!HAO: occasion, the dancers sometimes saw a crow inside the dance circle,
!!!HAO: no one except themselves being able to see it.  The singer said
!!!HAO: that she "dreamed" this song when she was a young girl.
!!!HTX: The crow, we see his likeness moving inside the circle of dancers.
