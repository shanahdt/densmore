!!!HAO:    The next was said to be a "true song" of a boy who is now dead.
!!!HAO: He once dreamed that he was in a grave and seemed unable to free
!!!HAO: himself from this impression.  Whenever this song was sung it
!!!HAO: "threw the boy into a Ghost dance fit."  The words are translated,
!!!HAO: "Here is the hole, right here."  The song was sung at a hand game
!!!HAO: or a Ghost dance.
!!!HTX: Here is the hole, right here.
