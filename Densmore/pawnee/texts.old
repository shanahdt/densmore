Long ago an old man named Nara'dudesa'ru had a dream
and in his dream he saw a cloud of dust rolling along
the ground.  He sat and looked at the dust a long
time until late in the afternoon.  Then it looked
like a crowd of people, but after the dust storm
had passed he saw a great herd of buffalo.

Listen, he said, yonder the buffalo are coming,
These are his sayings, yonder the buffalo are coming,
They walk, they stand, they are coming,
Yonder the buffalo are coming.
8
The next song is also concerning a dream of buffalo.
The herd was scattered and a man was watching them.
One of the buffalo lay down.  The man wondered
why the buffalo had lain down.  That night he
dreamed about the buffalo, who said that he had
"taken pitch" on the man.  The buffalo promised
the man that he would live to old age and be
able to foretell events a long time before
they came to pass.

Listen, he said,
There the buffalo are coming in a great herd,
These are his sayings,
there the buffalo are coming in a great herd,
The waves of dust roll downward,
There the buffalo are coming in a great herd,
They mark the place of the buffalo wallo.

At a certain point in the Lance dance witnessed
by the writer the decorated lances were carried
around the lodge and the following song was sung.
This constituted one of the most impressive portions
of the ceremony.  The song is very old and belonged
to a woman who had two sons, the song being sung
whenever they danced.  The woman lived to be so
old that she could not stand erect but she
"was always singing this song while she was cooking
or working."  The words mean "Father, the band of the
dead is coming."  The woman who recorded the song
was blind.

The next song was sung when all the participants
in the Bear dance were seated.  "Mother" was said
to refer to the moon, and there was said to be a
similar song containing the word "Father."  A young
man received this song in a dream, while mourning
for his parents who had died.  He saw a woman coming
toward him, and said, "Mother is coming."  The woman
said, "You have seen me, now you must learn this song."
The young man learned the song, lived a long time
afterwards, and took part in the Bear dance.  When
the song is used ceremonially there are six "stops"
or verses, the general meaning of which is as follows:

1. "Mother is coming."
2. The young man, devotional by nature, imagines that he
   is still mourning for his partents.
3. "Mother stands yonder."
4. The young man says, "Mother, standing in the sky, I
   want you to take pitch on me."
5. "Mother now ends" (stands still).
6. "I will now say, I mean the mother who alone stands
   forever in the sky" (the moon).

11
In the next song we have an expression of the belief
that a bear derives his "medicine power" from the sun
and that the center of that power is in his palms.
He stands facing the dawn in order that the first
rays of the sun may strike his paws, upheld for the
purpose.  In this manner he renews his power from
the sun.

An old man named Lata'piu, long ago, fell asleep, and
when he awoke he saw a strange sight.  The sun was rising
and a bear was pointing at the sunrise.  The old man
made this song about his vision and whenever he saw the
sunrise he sang the song.  Ever since that time the
song has been used in the Bear dance.

Listen, he said; he (the bear) stands,
I am telling this, yonder the bear stands,
It faces the east just before the sun appears,
Yonder the bear stands,
Now the sun is coming.

12
For a long time the Pawnee have called the cedar
tree "mother," a custom which had its origin in the
dream of a man who saw a cedar tree and thought it
was "like a woman."  He said, "This tree is made to
look the same in winter and summer, and to stand up
so nicely.  The leaves of other trees fall but this
tree is always green."  This strange woman-tree made
a noise like a bear and the song is used in the Bear
dance.

He said, a woman is here standing among the trees,
Now I am telling it,
A woman is here standing among the trees,
Loudly does she stand among the trees,
From where her spirit dwells she grunts (like a bear).

14
Many years ago the Pawnee fought the Sioux, killing many.
Among the Pawnee warriors was a man named Nada'kutade
(Eagle Chief), father-in-law of the man who recorded the
following song.  Eagle Chief owned this song and sang it
in the Bear dance.  The fight with the Sioux was said to
have taken place in a part of the country which was
thickly wooded, the battle resulting in a victory for
the Pawnee.

He said, the horse is shouting,
I am telling it, the horse is shouting,
Now I am telling it,
The horse is shouting at something he did.

15
The singer said that when he was a young man living in
Nebraska he saw a very old man who used a cane.  Even
with this aid he could scarcely walk.  This old man had
a dream in which he ascended a high hill and sat down.
The clouds were below him and he saw rain falling from
the clouds; he also saw about 40 white horses and
drove them; the white horses were probably the shapes
assumed by the clouds in his dream.  The following song
belonged to this old man but was not related to the
foregoing dream.  It was sung in the Bear dance.

Listen, he said, I come,
He told this to me,
I came to a place where I was lost in the timbre,
I came to the place,
Now I come.

16
The five remaining songs of the Bear dance were recorded
by Dog chief, whose father was one of the leading singers
at the Bear dance in old times and who therefore has
inherited the right to sing these songs.

I am like a bear,
I hold up my hands waiting for the sun to rise.

17
In describing this next song Dog Chief said that his
father took part in the war against the Sioux adn chased
a member of that tribe who held a shield over his back
as protection.  Dog Chief's father killed the Sioux and
captured his horse, this song commemorating his deed of
valor.

The words of the following song (not translated) state
that Dog Chief took horns like those of a buffalo and put
them on the horse he had captured.

19
When the man returned with the horse he had captured,
the people saw him running like a bear while the horse
was galloping.
This was commemorated in the following song.

20
The words of the next song were said to mean "I am a
brave man.  I am acting like a bear."  (The lack of a
competent interpreter when Dog Chief's songs were
recorded made it impossible to secure a more
extended description and translation.)

Two songs of the [deer] society were recorded by
Mark Evarts who said that his father was one of its
dancers.  He said that the ceremony of the Deer
Society lasted four days and nights and that this
song was sung just before daylight.

The chief speaks to his attendant, saying,
"Go out and see how the stars stand.
  Tell us how near is the morning."
The attendant returns and says,
"It is almost morning."
The chief says to the dancers,
"Wake up men.
  It is almost morning."

The chief speaks to his attendant, saying,
"Go out and see how the stars stand.
  Tell us how near is the morning."
The attendant returns and says,
"The morning star is coming up."
The chief says to the singers,
"Change the song.
  The morning star is rising."

23
The general idea of the next song is that it is better
to die bravely when young that to live to an enfeebled
old age.  In this, as in other Pawnee war songs, we see
a light estimate upon the value of life as compared to
success in war.  The song belonged originally to a
brave man who lived to an advanced age.  When this
was sung in a dance he rose and told the young men
that it was a painful thing to live to be so old.
The song was also sung by men in a battle, this being
the last song they sang "when they were all tired out
and so nearly beaten that even their hair was disheveled."
It was further stated that "sometimes when men were
having this dance an enemy attacked the village.
This was the song they sang as they drove the enemy away."
The song was also used in the scalp dances that followed
the return of a successful war party.

He comes.
It hurts to use a cane.
It becomes painful to pick it up.

24
The dance of the Raven Lance Society was said to be
"almost like that in which the dancers painted half
their bodies red and half black,"
referring to the
<A href="white.lance.society.html">White Lance Society.</A.
The original owner of this dance lived to extreme old
age and, as he had no children, he gave the dance to a
young man who was one of his nearest relatives.
One day the people said, "Some Indians are coming to
attack us."
The young man who had received the dance took his raven
lance, mounted his pony, and went to get the old man.
They rode together on the pony to a place near the
fight and then went forward on foot, but the old man
could not go as fast as the warriors.  The old man
called, "I am still coming," and the young man came
back and helped him forward.
The aged man was proud to see that the young man to
whom he had given his dance was among the leaders in
the fight.  The enemy shot and killed the young man,
and the lance was brought back with his body.  Then
the old man sang this song.  In the manner of recording
the song there was a wailing which was said to be
"the old man crying because the young man had been
killed and he had no more relatives," yet he loved the
lance and all that it symbolized.  He died soon afterwards
and, as he was too old to give the dance to anyone else,
the Pawnee do not have the dance at the present time.

(An exclamation of endearment)
Beloved emblem, they are carrying it foward,
Beloved emblem, they are bringing it back.

25
The next song belonged to the singer's father and
was his war song.

32
Three generations of Pawnee chiefs bore the name of Eagle Shield
and the song next following was said to have belonged to
the chief of the first generation.  The day after he returned
from a war expedition he mounted his best horse and rode around
the camp singing this song.  The words mean "I wonder how long
I am to live in this world."  In explanation it was said the
old warrior was wondering what his fate might be when he again
took the warpath.

A certain young man was afraid of the storm and wept when he
heard the thunder, but in a dream the thunder spoke to him slowly
and said, "Do not be afraid, your father is coming."  He heard
the thunder sing the following song, learned it, and sang it
when he went to war.  His name was Eage and he lived to be one
of the old warriors of the tribe.

34
In explanation of the following song it was said that long ago
there was a society called Iruska Virau (or Pirau), translated
"children of the Iruska."  Members of this society did everything
contrariwise.  Thus in a fight they would not fire at the enemy
unless commanded NOT to do so.  The song next following was said
to be a song of that society and was recorded by the chief of the
Chaui Band.  The same melody with different words was used by the
Skidi Band, the words of their version stating that a young man
was told in a dream that he would be killed the enxt day, but
felt no fear.  John Luwak, who recorded the song, said it was
his own war-dance song, explaining the words as follows: "A dead
person wanted a certain warrior to do right, so he said to him,
`If anyone is kind-hearted and good to the poor he is made a chief
and has a great name.  When he dies we in the spirit land are glad
and want to go and meet him because he was kind and good."

Beloved, come beloved, all of them spoke,
All of them spoke,
It is openly known that he did these things.

35
A woman's pleasure at the return of victorious warriors is
expressed in the following song which was sung at the Scalp
dances.  Among the Pawnee, as in other tribes, the scalps of
slain warriors were carried in the victory dance.

Ah, now I have seen you.
