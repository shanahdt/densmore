!!!HAO:    A certain man had a dream and in that dream one of his dead relatives
!!!HAO: appeared and said, "I have come back into this world.  You see me."  At
!!!HAO: the same time heard and learned the following song.  When the man awoke
!!!HAO: he remembered the song and understood what it meant.  He dreamed a second
!!!HAO: time, and the same dead relative appeared, saying, "Remember when we pass
!!!HAO: from the old earth we pass to a new earth where we are now."  The two songs
!!!HAO: were recorded and the melodies found to be the same.  The words of the first
!!!HAO: were translated, "I am coming," and the words of the second were, "Yonder,
!!!HAO: whence I came, our relatives are walking."
!!!HTX: I am coming.
