!!!HAO: Story of the Little Rattlesnake
!!!HAO:    This story differs from the preceding in that the entire narrative was
!!!HAO: sung, a typical portion of the melody begin transcribed.  The story was
!!!HAO: as follows:  In the place where the rattlesnakes lived there was a little
!!!HAO: rattlesnake who cried because he wanted his rattle to make a noise.  He
!!!HAO: said to his father, "I do not see why I don't rattle.  I am just like my
!!!HAO: brothers and sisters but their rattles rattle while mine does not."  His
!!!HAO: father said, "You are not old enough.  When you are as big as your
!!!HAO: brothers and sisters your rattle will rattle like theirs."
!!!HAO:    The little snake cried so hard that at last they "made medicine" for
!!!HAO: him so that his rattle would rattle.  Then he wanted to rattle it all
!!!HAO: the time.
!!!HAO:    The little snake said to his father, "Tell me how a chief's daughter
!!!HAO: looks.  I want to bite her foot."  His father said, "A chief's daughter 
!!!HAO: is very neat in her dress.  Those who are not the daughters of chiefs are
!!!HAO: very careless  You can tell the difference in that way."
!!!HAO:    The snakes' house was located on a road along which the Pawnee used
!!!HAO: to travel.  The oldest snake said, "Father, my little brother rattles all
!!!HAO: the time.  The Pawnee will hear him and kill us all.  Make him stop."
!!!HAO: But the little snake kept on.  He even went beside the road and rattled
!!!HAO: his rattle very loud.
!!!HAO:    One day a girl came along the road and the little snake thought she
!!!HAO: was the chief's daughter.  He bit her foot and she turned quickly and
!!!HAO: crushed his head.  The other snakes found him and the brother said,
!!!HAO: "Father, didn't I tell you that one of us would be killed?  There is my
!!!HAO: little brother with his head smashed."  That is the end of the story.
