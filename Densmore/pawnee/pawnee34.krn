!!!HAO:    In explanation of the following song it was said that long ago
!!!HAO: there was a society called Iruska Virau (or Pirau), translated
!!!HAO: "children of the Iruska."  Members of this society did everything
!!!HAO: contrariwise.  Thus in a fight they would not fire at the enemy
!!!HAO: unless commanded NOT to do so.  The song next following was said
!!!HAO: to be a song of that society and was recorded by the chief of the
!!!HAO: Chaui Band.  The same melody with different words was used by the
!!!HAO: Skidi Band, the words of their version stating that a young man
!!!HAO: was told in a dream that he would be killed the next day, but
!!!HAO: felt no fear.  John Luwak, who recorded the song, said it was
!!!HAO: his own war-dance song, explaining the words as follows: "A dead
!!!HAO: person wanted a certain warrior to do right, so he said to him,
!!!HAO: `If anyone is kind-hearted and good to the poor he is made a chief
!!!HAO: and has a great name.  When he dies we in the spirit land are glad
!!!HAO: and want to go and meet him because he was kind and good."
!!!HTX: Beloved, come beloved, all of them spoke,
!!!HTX: All of them spoke,
!!!HTX: It is openly known that he did these things.
