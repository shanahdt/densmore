!!!HAO:    There was a village and a man who used to run around by himself.  He was
!!!HAO: Coyote.  He went and sat on a hill looking down and he saw a big flock
!!!HAO: of turkeys.  He was hungry, as coyotes always are, and he thought, "I am
!!!HAO: going to get one of them."  So he went down.  The turkeys nudged each
!!!HAO: other and said, "There comes a thief."  He looks hungry.  We must look
!!!HAO: out for him.  He is tricky."  They all said that.  Coyote said to the
!!!HAO: turkeys, "Grandchildren, let us have a little game."  The turkeys said,
!!!HAO: "What kind of game are we going to have?"  Coyote said, "Well, don't let
!!!HAO: us have a game, let us have a dance."  The turkeys said, "All right, let
!!!HAO: us have a dance."
!!!HAO:    Coyote looked at the turkeys.  Some were big, fat ones.  He selected about
!!!HAO: six of the biggest and fattest and said, "You must stand in front."  Then
!!!HAO: he arranged two rows back of them.  Then said, "I have a song.  While you
!!!HAO: dance you must close your eyes.  When I begin to sing you must all close
!!!HAO: your eyes."  He kept his eyes open and he say one turkey with its eyes
!!!HAO: open.  He said, "Close your eyes, you are looking at me."  He sang again,
!!!HAO: and after a while he saw they all had their eyes shut.  He had a club in
!!!HAO: his hand but he kept on singing.  The turkeys all had their eyes shut and
!!!HAO: he killed all in the front row.  The rest flew away before he could kill
!!!HAO: them.  The he said that he would have a feast for his wives and his
!!!HAO: children.  He said, "Turkeys have not much sense."
!!!HTX: Put your heads down,
!!!HTX: Move your hips as you dance.
