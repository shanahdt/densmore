!!!HAO:    In a certain village were two young boys.  They were good-looking
!!!HAO: lads and wore their hair long on the right side of the head.  One day
!!!HAO: the younger boy thought he would go to another village in the woods.
!!!HAO: When he came near this village he saw the smoke of a tipi that stood
!!!HAO: by itself among the willows.  He went there and stood outside the entrance.
!!!HAO: In this tipi lived an old woman and her three granddaughters.  The old
!!!HAO: woman told the youngest girl to go outside and see if anyone was there.
!!!HAO: the girl saw the strange lad and returned, saying "O grandmother, there
!!!HAO: is a good-looking young man outside."  The old woman wanted to speak with
!!!HAO: him and said, 'You had better go to some village where the people have money.
!!!HAO: We are very poor."  But the lad replied, "No. I cam here and this is where
!!!HAO: I belong."  The old woman said, "Well, come in," and the boy entered the
!!!HAO: tipi.  Later the old woman said, "You had better go away for the chief of
!!!HAO: our band is very unkind to strangers.  You must watch, for Longnose (Coyote)
!!!HAO: will come before daylight to see if anyone is here.  He will see you and
!!!HAO: tell the chief, who will ask you to breakfast.  If he offers you dry
!!!HAO: pumpkin do not eat it, nor corn, nor mush.  Bring it home with you."
!!!HAO: Before daylight, as the old woman had predicted, Coyote came to see if
!!!HAO: anyone was in the tipi.  The old woman said, "See my grandson, how
!!!HAO: good-looking he is.  He ought to go where the big men are."  Coyote ran
!!!HAO: at once to the chief and said, "O chief, there is a good looking young
!!!HAO: man down at the old woman's tipi.  When you kill him he will be the leader
!!!HAO: of your heads."  (Referring to a row of the heads of men killed by the
!!!HAO: chief that had been put in his tipi.)  The chief said, "Run down to the old
!!!HAO: woman's tipi and bring the young man.  I want to feast him."  Coyote ran
!!!HAO: as fast as he could.  The old woman saw him coming and again told the
!!!HAO: young man not to eat anything but to bring the food home.  Coyote said to
!!!HAO: the young man, "You certainly are good-looking."  When the chief saw the
!!!HAO: young man he said, "I sent for you to eat with me," and offered him dry
!!!HAO: pumpkin, corn, much, and other food.  The lad replied, "O grandfather, I
!!!HAO: am full; I have had my breakfast; I will take this home to my grandmother."
!!!HAO: Coyote went with him and waited while the old woman emptied and washed
!!!HAO: the bowls.  Then Coyote took the bowls back to the chief.  After the boy
!!!HAO: refused to eat the food, the chief wanted him to play the "stick game."
!!!HAO: He refused at first but finally he said that he would play in two days,
!!!HAO: saying he must wait because he was so tired.  The chief said, "Choose a
!!!HAO: day and we will play."  The boy went home and told the old woman that he
!!!HAO: was to play the stick game with the chief.  She said, "O my boy, you did
!!!HAO: wrong to consent.  You saw those heads in the chief's tent.  He will kill
!!!HAO: you and all our people."
!!!HAO: Before daylight on the day of the game Coyote opened the old woman's door
!!!HAO: and said, "The chief is at the place for the game, he is waiting for you."
!!!HAO: The boy replied, "I will go when I am ready."  Later they began to play
!!!HAO: the stick game.  The boy had people on his side and also a bird-man
!!!HAO: (bird turned into a man), who watched everything.  Coyote watched
!!!HAO: everything on the chief's side.  the boy had nothing to wager so he bet
!!!HAO: the people who were on his side, and at last he was obliged to bet himself.
!!!HAO: The old chief won, so the people on the chief's side killed all the people
!!!HAO: on the boy's side.  They even killed the boy.  Then they cut off all the
!!!HAO: heads and put them up with the other heads in the chief's lodge.
!!!HAO: While this was happening the elder of the two boys, mentioned at the
!!!HAO: beginning of this story, grew uneasy about his brother.  He determined
!!!HAO: to find him and traced him to the village, then he went home, got his
!!!HAO: bow and arrows, and went to the old woman's tipi.  The old woman did
!!!HAO: as before, sending the same girl to see if anyone were outside.  The
!!!HAO: girl returned and said, "It looks as though that good-looking boy had
!!!HAO: come to life."  The old woman invited him into the tend but said as
!!!HAO: before, "O my grandson, why do you come here.  You ought to go where
!!!HAO: the rich people are."  He replied as his brother had done, "No, I want
!!!HAO: to be here."  They were so poor that they gave him only one bean from
!!!HAO: those they had gathered.  At night the old woman said as before, "O my
!!!HAO: grandson, I wish you would go away.  Go somewhere else or go home, for
!!!HAO: someone will come early in the morning to look all around the place."
!!!HAO: Everything happened exactly as before.  Coyote came, found the young
!!!HAO: man, and took him to the chief, who offered him food.  The young man
!!!HAO: replied, as his brother had done, that he was not hungry, and he took the
!!!HAO: food home.  The chief asked him to play the stick game and he said that
!!!HAO: he was too tired to play that day.  It was decided that they would play in
!!!HAO: a few days.  The boy went home and said to his grandmother, "I am going to
!!!HAO: play the stick game with the chief.  To-morrow I want you to clean up the
!!!HAO: house and put everything one side, then I want you all to go into the woods.
!!!HAO: Do not try to look into the house until I call you."  Then he asked, "Is
!!!HAO: there any place around here where the people used to kill buffalo?"
!!!HAO: She replied, "Yes, over there by the hill."
!!!HAO: After they had gone the young man took the pipe out of the sacred bundle
!!!HAO: that the old woman kept.  Before daylight he filled the pipe and went toward
!!!HAO: the place where they used to kill the buffalo.  When he reached the place
!!!HAO: he found many buffalo bones.  He held the stem of the pipe down toward the
!!!HAO: buffalo bones and sang the following song.
!!!HTX: Father, I have brought this pipe for you to smoke.
!!!HTX: I am lonely for my brother.
