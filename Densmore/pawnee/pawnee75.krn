!!!HAO: Story of Nuri and His Brother.
!!!HAO: Related by Mrs. Mary Murie.
!!!HAO:    The narrator of [this] story said that it did not originate with the
!!!HAO: Pawnee and she thought that it came from the Omaha in Nebraska.
!!!HAO: There was a man so jealous of his wife that he determined to take her
!!!HAO: away from the village.  He told her to pack everything and they would go.
!!!HAO: They took plenty of dried meat, pounded meat, corn, and all kinds of food,
!!!HAO: and left the village.  When night came they camped.  They were far from
!!!HAO: any people and her husband said they would stay in that place.  He was a
!!!HAO: good hunter and killed deer, turkeys, and other game.  After a while they
!!!HAO: made an earth lodge to live in.  Every morning the man put plenty of meat
!!!HAO: beside the fire, brought some water, and told his wife to stay in the lodge
!!!HAO: until his return.  He was gone until night.
!!!HAO:    In time his wife bore a child and named it Nuri.  Indeed she bore twin
!!!HAO: boys, but her husband did not notice the second child and buried it with
!!!HAO: the afterbirth.  The second child crawled out of the ground and lived
!!!HAO: with the animals, but his mother never knew.  Her husband told her, as
!!!HAO: before, that she must stay in the lodge.  He said that he had seen some
!!!HAO: bad people prowling about.  One day, when the man was away, these bad
!!!HAO: people cam to the lodge.  His wife was sitting beside the fire and the
!!!HAO: baby was asleep when she heard a sound and looked toward the door.  Even
!!!HAO: men entered the lodge and said, "Give us something to eat.  We know that
!!!HAO: you have plenty of food."  She did not reply but pointed to the meat that
!!!HAO: was cooking on sticks around the fire.  They ate it all and went away.
!!!HAO: After they had gone she exclaimed, "Those horrid men ate all my meat."
!!!HAO: One heard it and said to the others, "She called us names."  So they all
!!!HAO: went into the lodge and killed her.  They did not see the baby but they
!!!HAO: carried the woman's body to their camp and devoured it.  When the man
!!!HAO: came home he looked for his wife, and seeing the tracks he knew the wicked
!!!HAO: people had taken her.  The man grieved greatly for his wife.
!!!HAO:    By this time the baby was old enough to walk and walk.  Every morning
!!!HAO: before the man went to hunt he fixed the meat ready to cook and told the
!!!HAO: little boy to play inside the lodge.  One day he went away as usual, after
!!!HAO: fixing the meat, and the little boy thought, "I will go outside.  I never
!!!HAO: have seen what it is like out there."  He went out and saw a little boy
!!!HAO: coming toward him.  The boy was about his own size and was singing the
!!!HAO: following song.  [story continued in next song]
