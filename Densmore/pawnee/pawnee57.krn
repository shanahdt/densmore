!!!HAO:    This and the succeeding song were not used in the hand game.  The
!!!HAO: singer said that he composed this song when waking from a trance in
!!!HAO: the Ghost dance.  He dreamed of a yellow star which came to him and
!!!HAO: said, "I am the star which you see in the sky at night."  The star
!!!HAO: was in the form of a woman holding in her hand an eagle feather
!!!HAO: painted yellow.  She gave him the feather, saying, "All the stars in
!!!HAO: the sky are people."  A dream of the yellow star was induced by
!!!HAO: watching the star when in a ghost dance trance.  The favor of "yellow
!!!HAO: star" was greatly desired as she does not appear to many dancers, but
!!!HAO: she gives to her favored friends the right to wear a yellow eagle
!!!HAO: feather upright in their hair and to use it in hypnotizing other
!!!HAO: dancers.  If such a feather is used under a false pretense no results
!!!HAO: can be obtained.
!!!HTX: The yellow star has noticed me,
!!!HTX: Furthermore it gave me a standing yellow feather,
!!!HTX: That yellow star.
