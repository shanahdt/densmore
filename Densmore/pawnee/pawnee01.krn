!!!HAO: Morning Star Ceremony
!!!HAO:    A sacred bundle of the Skidi Pawnee was associated with Morning Star
!!!HAO: and its ceremony was held in the early spring, having for its object the
!!!HAO: securing of good crops in the coming season.  It was the writer's
!!!HAO: privilege to see the Morning Star bundle in the house of the woman who
!!!HAO: was its keeper, and also to see its contents exposed in the ceremony.
!!!HAO: The bundle, in accordance with custom, was hung on the west wall of its
!!!HAO: owner's house, and with it were hung four large gourds, symbolizing the
!!!HAO: four deities who were the special guardians of Evening Star and also
!!!HAO: representing the breasts of the two women in the west, Evening Star and
!!!HAO: Moon.
!!!HAO:    The legend from which the Morning Star ceremony arose was related by
!!!HAO: Coming Sun, whose grandfather was a high priest in the Morning Star village
!!!HAO: and who received his name by inheritance from this ancestor.  With Coming
!!!HAO: Sun's narrative is combined a limited number of details mention by Linton
!!!HAO: in "Sacrifice to the Morning Star by the Skidi Pawnee."
!!!HAO:    As already stated, Morning Star ruled in the east and Evening Star in
!!!HAO: the west.  All the stars west of the Milky Way were feminine and those to
!!!HAO: the east were masculine, but the most powerful were Morning Star and
!!!HAO: Evening Star.  Sun was with the former and Moon was a companion of the
!!!HAO: latter.  One after another the eastern star came to court the stars in the
!!!HAO: west, in order that man might be placed on the earth.  Moon welcomed them
!!!HAO: and walked with them toward the west, but as soon as they came in sight of
!!!HAO: the village she caused the ground to open so the man fell through and was
!!!HAO: killed.  At last Morning Star resolved to go and woo the great Evening Star,
!!!HAO: taking his little brother along to carry his pack.  Thus, according to
!!!HAO: Coming Sun, a small star always appears near and slightly below the
!!!HAO: morning star in the spring, representing the little brother.  Linton,
!!!HAO: however, states that Morning Star was accompanied by Sun, who carried a
!!!HAO: sacred bundle with a war club.
!!!HAO:    Ten obstacles were encountered by Morning Star and his companion, the
!!!HAO: first five being difficulties of travel, such as sharp flints and sword
!!!HAO: grass beneath their feet, and the last five being animals which attached
!!!HAO: them, including the mountain lion, wildcat, buffalo, and bear.  All these
!!!HAO: were placed in their way by Moon, who thought she could conquer them as
!!!HAO: she had conquered the others.  But Morning Star carried a ball encased in
!!!HAO: such a manner that when he threw it the casing broke and it became a ball
!!!HAO: of fire.  When throwing the ball he sang the following song, which was
!!!HAO: said to be one of the principal songs in the ceremony.  Linton states that
!!!HAO: Morning Star struck the ground with his war club, closing the cracks made
!!!HAO: by Moon for his destruction, and that he sang a song with substantially the
!!!HAO: same words recorded by Coming Sun.
!!!HAO:    The tenth obstacle was not encountered by Morning Star until after he
!!!HAO: entered the lodge of Evening Star.  The obstacle was a snake, but he
!!!HAO: overcame it, as he had overcome the others, by means of the ball of fire
!!!HAO: and the song.
!!!HAO:    Even Star saw that his power was greater than heres, but she determined
!!!HAO: to hold him aloof as long as possible.  Finally, she insisted that he make
!!!HAO: provision for the child that should be born; she even required him to
!!!HAO: provide perfumed water for bathing the child and a cradle board in which
!!!HAO: it should be placed.  On the hoop, or arch, of this cradle board was
!!!HAO: painted a morning star and the lightnings, this custom being followed by
!!!HAO: the Pawnee at the present time.  Evening Star also required him to plant a
!!!HAO: tree in front of the lodge so that the mocking birds might nest there and
!!!HAO: sing to the child.  From this union a daughter was born.  She cam down to
!!!HAO: earth and wandered about in fear.  As she was running hither and thither she
!!!HAO: met a boy, the child of Sun and Moon, and these two became the ancestors of
!!!HAO: the human race.
!!!HAO:    Morning Star made a bundle and placed in it various articles connected
!!!HAO: with the obstacles he had overcome on his westward journey.  He left this
!!!HAO: bundle with Evening Star and for that reason a woman has always been the
!!!HAO: keeper of the sacred bundle.  Other articles have been added from time to
!!!HAO: time and will be noted in this paper.
!!!HAO:    It is said that Evening Star required a human sacrifice as her reward.
!!!HAO: This sacrifice must be a pure and beautiful maiden and she demanded that
!!!HAO: the sacrifice be repeated annually.  Long ago, Morning Star sometimes
!!!HAO: appeared to a man in a dream and told him to secure a maiden for this
!!!HAO: sacrifice.  According to Linton, a man who had this vision went to the
!!!HAO: keeper of the Morning Star bundle and received the warrior's costume and
!!!HAO: the sacred objects kept for such an expedition.  Other warriors joined him
!!!HAO: and, preliminary to the expedition, they enacted the journey of the
!!!HAO: Morning Star, and sang the song with which he overcame the obstacles placed
!!!HAO: in his way. (Cf. Song No. 1)  When the ceremony ended it was almost time
!!!HAO: for the Morning Star to rise and the leader went outside the lodge and
!!!HAO: addressed an invocation to him.  After dancing furiously around their fire
!!!HAO: and offering a last prayer to Morning Star the warriors started forth and
!!!HAO: captured a maiden from the enemy.  Returning, they gave her into the care
!!!HAO: of the chief of the Morning Star village until the time for her sacrifice.
!!!HAO: She was treated in a ceremonial manner but kept in ignorance of her fate.
!!!HAO: At the appointed time her body was painted, half red and half black, and
!!!HAO: she was tied to a scaffold and shot through the heart with an arrow.  It
!!!HAO: was said that the braided thong used to bind the girl to the scaffold is
!!!HAO: now in the Morning Star bundle.
!!!HAO:    Tradition states that on one occasion the intended victim was rescued.
!!!HAO: On the night preceding her execution she was seated beside some tall
!!!HAO: sunflowers.  A young chief came through the tall weed and stole her away,
!!!HAO: putting her on his horse and taking her to Fort Leavenworth, whence she
!!!HAO: was returned to her own people.  She died within three months, having
!!!HAO: been anointed for death with the sacred ointment of red paint and buffalo
!!!HAO: fat.  This occurred about the year 1818.  The man who rescued the intended
!!!HAO: victim was a warrior of distinction and through his influence the custom
!!!HAO: was discontinued.  The ritual of the sacrifice is still rendered but no
!!!HAO: actual sacrifice has taken place since that date.
!!!HAO:    Coming Sun, who sings the ceremonial songs, said that sometimes, during
!!!HAO: the Morning Star ceremony he stops and says "Listen," and the people hear
!!!HAO: a woman's voice singing the songs above his head.
!!!HAO:    The Morning Star ceremony was held by the Skidi Band near Pawnee,
!!!HAO: Okla., on April 17, 1920.  This ceremony formerly lasted four days and
!!!HAO: nights, ending when the morning star appeared in the east, but at the
!!!HAO: present time it is concluded in one day.  On this occasion the writer
!!!HAO: had the honor of entering the lodge, through the courtesy of Coming Sun.
!!!HAO: It is said that one other white person, Dr. G. A. Dorsey, has entered the
!!!HAO: lodge during the ceremony and seen the contents of the sacred bundle.
!!!HAO:    The ceremony was held in a tipi erected for the occasion in a quiet
!!!HAO: spot near the house of the keeper of the bundle, north of Pawnee.  This
!!!HAO: tipi has been used in the Ghost dance and was decorated with Ghost dance
!!!HAO: symbols.  The adjacent landscape is shown in Plate 3,c.  The ceremony
!!!HAO: began at about 9 a.m. and continued until 4 p.m., the writer sitting
!!!HAO: outside the tipi except for the brief time she was permitted to enter.
!!!HAO: Thus the entire songs of the ceremony were heard, as well as the prayers
!!!HAO: and rituals, though only the principal song was obtained.  At the proper
!!!HAO: time Coming Sun, who was in charge of the ceremony, sent a message to
!!!HAO: summon the writer and she entered the lodge, passing to the right and
!!!HAO: standing near the bundle before which she laid gifts of calico, tobacco,
!!!HAO: and money.  Coming Sun was seated back of the bundle, directly opposite
!!!HAO: the entrance, and held one of the sacred gourd rattles.  Two men at either
!!!HAO: side of him held similar rattles.  In front of the men at Coming Sun's
!!!HAO: left and next [to] the sacred bundle was a belt decorated
