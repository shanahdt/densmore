!!!HAO:    As the young man sang [the previous] song [No. 72] the bones came to life
!!!HAO: and made a noise like a great many buffalo.  He said, "Now, fathers,
!!!HAO: grandfathers and grandmothers, I want you to pity me.  That is why I sang."
!!!HAO: They replied, "All right."  Then a middle-aged buffalo with shining horns
!!!HAO: came toward him and said, "I will be the first to help you.  We know about
!!!HAO: the wicked chief and what he has been doing."  The buffalo threw himself down
!!!HAO: down and when he got up he shook himself.  Where he had been lying the boy
!!!HAO: saw a game stick.  The buffalo said, "Take this stick."  A young buffalo
!!!HAO: did the same and gave the boy another stick.  Then a young buffalo cow did
!!!HAO: the same and when she arose the boy saw a game ring which she told him
!!!HAO: to use.  The boy brought the two sticks and the ring home with him and
!!!HAO: hung them beside the sacred bundle.  On the day of the game he told his
!!!HAO: grandmother that he would send someone for the sticks and the ring but
!!!HAO: did not want anyone to be at home when the messenger came.
!!!HAO:    In the morning Coyote came as before and said that all was ready for the
!!!HAO: game.  Everything was the same as when the younger man played, the chief
!!!HAO: having Coyote and the man having the bird-man on his side.  They began
!!!HAO: to play and the chief won as before.  The boy had no goods so he bet the
!!!HAO: people, as his brother had done.  The chief said, "Now you have bet all
!!!HAO: the people, you ought to bet yourself."  The young man said "All right."
!!!HAO: Then his stick struck the chief's stick and broke it in two.  The young
!!!HAO: man said, "Thanks.  Now I will not be killed."  The chief said, "Perhaps
!!!HAO: you have some gaming sticks somewhere."  The man said, "Yes," and sent
!!!HAO: Coyote to get them, adding, "They are common sticks, lying on the floor."
!!!HAO: Coyote went to the old woman's lodge, opened the door and heard a noise
!!!HAO: as of many buffalo.  He was frightened and ran back.  The chief sent
!!!HAO: another messenger, who brought the same report.  Then the boy sent the
!!!HAO: bird-man, who brought the sticks and the ring.  They did not make any
!!!HAO: noise when he entered the lodge for they knew he was the right person.
!!!HAO: The boy played with the sticks and had good luck.  He won back all the
!!!HAO: people, and the chief's leg was broken.  Then the boy sang this song.
!!!HAO: They played again and the chief said, "Throw the sticks toward the east."
!!!HAO: They threw the sticks toward the east and the boy's stick went through
!!!HAO: the hoop and went on and on, and finally it turned into a buffalo.  As
!!!HAO: soon as the chief's people saw the stick turn into a buffalo they began
!!!HAO: to cry, but the boy's people began to rejoice.
!!!HAO:    The young man asked, "Where is my brother's head?"  They told him.
!!!HAO: He asked, "Where are his bones?"  They told him this also.  Then he
!!!HAO: laid his brother's bones in order on the ground, with the head at one end.
!!!HAO: Then he stood below his brother's foot and kicked the foot, saying,
!!!HAO: "Why are you sleeping so long?"  His brother arose and said, "Yes, I have
!!!HAO: been asleep a long time," and smoothed his hair.
!!!HAO:    They killed the chief where the game had been played and they killed all
!!!HAO: the chief's people.  Then the two brother returned to their own village.
!!!HTX: You are a good gambler.
!!!HTX: They say you are a good gambler.
!!!HTX: Get up and play.
