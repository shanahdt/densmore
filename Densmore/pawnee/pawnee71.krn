!!!HAO:    Mr. James R. Murie and other old members of the tribe said that love
!!!HAO: songs, in the white man's use of the term, were unknown among the
!!!HAO: better class of Pawnee in the early days.  According to Mr. Murie,
!!!HAO: there were four classes of Pawnee, the lowest being considered outcasts
!!!HAO: by the remainder of the tribe.  These people camped near towns and
!!!HAO: worked for white people, from whom they obtained whisky.  This class
!!!HAO: of Pawnee sang what were termed "crazy people's songs," which were
!!!HAO: associated with "love charms" and evil influences.  No effort was
!!!HAO: made to secure examples of these songs.  A change from the former
!!!HAO: attitude toward women, however, is shown in the following song which
!!!HAO: was said to be very old.  It is not of so low a character as the
!!!HAO: "crazy people's songs," neither does it represent the high standard
!!!HAO: of life indicated in the former songs of this group.  A girl married
!!!HAO: a man for whom she did not care and it would appear that, instead of
!!!HAO: adapting himself to the situation, he sought consolation elsewhere.
