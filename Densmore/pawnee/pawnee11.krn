!!!HAO:    In the next song we have an expression of the belief
!!!HAO: that a bear derives his "medicine power" from the sun
!!!HAO: and that the center of that power is in his palms.
!!!HAO: He stands facing the dawn in order that the first
!!!HAO: rays of the sun may strike his paws, upheld for the
!!!HAO: purpose.  In this manner he renews his power from
!!!HAO: the sun.
!!!HAO:    An old man named Lata'piu, long ago, fell asleep, and
!!!HAO: when he awoke he saw a strange sight.  The sun was rising
!!!HAO: and a bear was pointing at the sunrise.  The old man
!!!HAO: made this song about his vision and whenever he saw the
!!!HAO: sunrise he sang the song.  Ever since that time the
!!!HAO: song has been used in the Bear dance.
!!!HTX:    Listen, he said; he (the bear) stands,
!!!HTX: I am telling this, yonder the bear stands,
!!!HTX: It faces the east just before the sun appears,
!!!HTX: Yonder the bear stands,
!!!HTX: Now the sun is coming.
