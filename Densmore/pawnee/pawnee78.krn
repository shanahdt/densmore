!!!HAO:    When the Pawnee first saw a horse they were frightened.  Some ran away
!!!HAO: and others said, "I wonder what he is dragging behind him" (referring to
!!!HAO: his tail).  A great crowd of people was looking at the horse.  At last
!!!HAO: someone said, "Why are you afraid of this animal.  He is very useful.  He
!!!HAO: can carry you and your packs.  You can get on him and he will take you
!!!HAO: from place to place so that you can kill game."  Ever since that time the
!!!HAO: Pawnee have owned horses, and found that horses could work for them.
!!!HTX: What are those that come?
!!!HTX: Those yonder, what are those that come?
!!!HTX: The horse, you fear it,
!!!HTX: What are those that come?
