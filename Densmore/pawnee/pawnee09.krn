!!!HAO:    At a certain point in the Lance dance witnessed
!!!HAO: by the writer the decorated lances were carried
!!!HAO: around the lodge and the following song was sung.
!!!HAO: This constituted one of the most impressive portions
!!!HAO: of the ceremony.  The song is very old and belonged
!!!HAO: to a woman who had two sons, the song being sung
!!!HAO: whenever they danced.  The woman lived to be so
!!!HAO: old that she could not stand erect but she
!!!HAO: "was always singing this song while she was cooking
!!!HAO: or working."  The words mean "Father, the band of the
!!!HAO: dead is coming."  The woman who recorded the song
!!!HAO: was blind.
