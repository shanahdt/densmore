!!!HAO:    The dance of the Raven Lance Society was said to be
!!!HAO: "almost like that in which the dancers painted half
!!!HAO: their bodies red and half black,"
!!!HAO: referring to the
!!!HAO: <A href="white.lance.society.html">White Lance Society.</A.
!!!HAO: The original owner of this dance lived to extreme old
!!!HAO: age and, as he had no children, he gave the dance to a
!!!HAO: young man who was one of his nearest relatives.
!!!HAO: One day the people said, "Some Indians are coming to
!!!HAO: attack us."
!!!HAO: The young man who had received the dance took his raven
!!!HAO: lance, mounted his pony, and went to get the old man.
!!!HAO: They rode together on the pony to a place near the
!!!HAO: fight and then went forward on foot, but the old man
!!!HAO: could not go as fast as the warriors.  The old man
!!!HAO: called, "I am still coming," and the young man came
!!!HAO: back and helped him forward.
!!!HAO: The aged man was proud to see that the young man to
!!!HAO: whom he had given his dance was among the leaders in
!!!HAO: the fight.  The enemy shot and killed the young man,
!!!HAO: and the lance was brought back with his body.  Then
!!!HAO: the old man sang this song.  In the manner of recording
!!!HAO: the song there was a wailing which was said to be
!!!HAO: "the old man crying because the young man had been
!!!HAO: killed and he had no more relatives," yet he loved the
!!!HAO: lance and all that it symbolized.  He died soon afterwards
!!!HAO: and, as he was too old to give the dance to anyone else,
!!!HAO: the Pawnee do not have the dance at the present time.
!!!HTX: (An exclamation of endearment)
!!!HTX: Beloved emblem, they are carrying it forward,
!!!HTX: Beloved emblem, they are bringing it back.
